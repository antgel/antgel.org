Israel's capital, a source of human fascination and a magnet for
spirituality, ever since (and before) human beings started recording
history.

It's surprisingly large, and hilly, so great for fitness if you're
into walking. When you get tired, there's always the light rail,
buses, and taxis.

## Old City העיר העתיקה

The heart of the heart of the heart of the matter. Inaccessible to
Jews and rife with snipers whilst under Jordanian control following the end of
the
[1948 War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War),
until Israel's victory in
the [1967 Six-Day War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War). The
history of this tiny area alone can fill endless books. The abundance
of tourists doesn't affect the unique mystical atmosphere (or is that
simply the tension in the air)? Market traders do thrive on tourists,
try to avoid eye contact unless you actually want to buy something,
and if you do, haggle like you're in the Middle East.

Divided into four quarters (Jewish / Christian / Muslim /
Armenian), the Old City could easily take several days' to explore. I
wouldn't recommend displaying anything of religious or national
significance, unless you know exactly what you're doing. This is a
complex, emotionally-charged place, where you'll find T-shirts for
sale with slogans like "Free Palestine" (image of entire Israel in
blood-red, no suggestion of two states living in peace, side by side),
or "America Don't Worry, Israel is Behind You".

Some of my highlights:

* [Temple Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount) הר הבית:
  The holiest site in Judaism, and the location of the [Second
  Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple) from 516 BCE to
  70 CE, when the Romans nearly wiped the Jews out. When the Muslims
  conquered Jerusalem in the 7th century, they built the [Dome of the
  Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_of_the_Rock) mosque on the
  site. Since 1967, the site has been administered by the (Jordanian)
  Islamic Waqf. Non-Muslims may only enter through 1 of the 11 gates, at
  specific hours and days, and even to those non-Muslims who do
  enter, access to mosques is forbidden. *At the time of writing (July
  2017), totally closed to non-Muslims in the wake of controversy
  following a [terrorist
  attack](http://www.timesofisrael.com/three-said-hurt-in-shooting-attack-in-jerusalems-old-city/),
  in which Arabs killed Druze Border Police, and subsequent
  [installation of metal
  detectors](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4991187,00.html).*
* [Western Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Wall) הכותל
  המערבי: An Israeli and Jewish icon. Named due to being one of the
  retaining walls, and all that remains of the Second Temple. A new,
  unmissable development, is tours of the recently-excavated
  [tunnels](https://english.thekotel.org/western_wall_sites/western_wall_tunnels/).
  Annoyingly, these do require booking in advance. Technically a
  synagogue, so modest clothing recommended.
* [Church of the Holy
  Sepulchre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre):
  Without doubt one of the most impressive Christian holy sites on the
  planet. I don't have words to describe its enchanting, peaceful aura.
  Religion is never far from controversy, here affairs are dictated by a
  [status
  quo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre#Status_quo)
  going back to 1853, with the equally thought-provoking and prepostrous
  [Immovable Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immovable_Ladder),
  stuck in its current position since the 18th century, except for being
  removed and replaced in a 1997 prank or conflict, depending on who you
  believe.
* [Ramparts Walk](https://www.itraveljerusalem.com/ent/ramparts-walk/):
  A chance to walk around the Old City from the top of its walls. Not
  easy, especially on a hot day, although a great overview.
* [Jewish
  Quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Quarter_(Jerusalem)):
  The newest parts of the Old City are here, following rebuilding due to
  the widespread destruction under Jordanian rule from 1948-1967, during
  which 34 out of 35 synagogues were destroyed.
* [Mount of Olives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_of_Olives): Not
  in the Old City as such, but "around the back" if coming from the
  usual routes. Boasts an amazing view of all of Jerusalem. Probably the
  most famous Jewish cemetery in the world, heavily vandalized under
  Jordanian rule. According to some tradition, when the [End of
  Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_time) arrives, the
  [Resurrection of the
  Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_eschatology#Resurrection_of_the_dead)
  will start here when the Messiah arrives and makes his / her / its way
  to the Temple Mount. (I didn't make that up, I'm just the messenger.)

## Other things to do

* [Yad Vashem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad_Vashem): The
  world-famous Holocaust museum, located on Mount Herzl.  Following
  refurbishment in 2005, it's an unparalleled assault on the senses. The
  subject matter is unarguably bleak, yet the presentation is admirable,
  and the ending, which I won't spoil, is... Anyway, budget at least a
  couple of hours, and more if you're keen not to rush. I'd recommend
  getting the sadness out of the way at the start of the day.
* [Mount Herzl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Herzl): The
  location of Yad Vashem, and the most famous cemetery in Israel, where
  legendary political and military leaders, and Zionist visionaries,
  including Theodor Herzl himself, are laid to rest.
* [Jerusalem Light
  Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Light_Rail): Perhaps
  the leading symbol of Jerusalem moving into the modern world, and
  often cited as a symbol of bringing people together, given its
  passing-through Arab neighbourhoods. The best way to get to Yad Vashem
  and Mount Herzl from the town centre.
* [Machane Yehuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahane_Yehuda_Market):
  The most famous market in Israel, recently renovated but losing none
  of its unique charm and atmosphere. In recent years, has become a
  happening nightspot, full of cool bars and restaurants.
* [Yemin Moshe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemin_Moshe) ימין משה: A
  beautiful, tranquil, arty neighbourhood, across from the Old City.
* [Israel Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Museum): A
  seriously impressive collection, including architecture, fine and
  Jewish art, and the incredible artefacts of the [Dead Sea
  Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls).
* [The Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset): The site of the
  Israeli parliament, offers [guided
  tours](https://www.knesset.gov.il/tour/eng/evisit.htm) for those who
  wish to see where the big debates are fought, and decisions are made.
  Israel has *never* had a non-coalition government, so it's debatable
  which of the two is more common.
