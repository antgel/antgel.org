I'm often asked to recommend things to do for tourists visiting
Israel. One one hand, there's no need to reinvent the wheel:

* [Go Israel](https://goisrael.com): official site, recently updated,
  surprisingly varied and interesting.
* [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Israel): useful
  crowdsourced travel site under the Wikimedia umbrella.
* [tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g293977-Israel-Vacations.html):
  widely-used portal with rankings, reviews, and lots of useful data.
* Yelp isn't a thing here, yet.
* Netflix is, but it's [severely limited](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Netflix-Israel-wont-have-House-of-Cards-other-hits-440753).
* [Chill is too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVy8pNscbNk).

Now we've gotten the formalities out of the way, let's get started.

## Overview

[Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel) is
a [small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Israel) country
in the Middle East, surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan, and Egypt, home
to [8.6 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel)
people. It is a synergy of a rich historic past, with ambition and
optimism for the future.

[Formed in 1948](http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/declaration%20of%20establishment%20of%20state%20of%20israel.aspx),
and fighting for its survival [ever since day
one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War),
Israel is a global leader in many areas, including science, technology,
defence, and innovation. Dan Senor's book, [Start-Up
Nation](https://www.bookdepository.com/Start-Up-Nation-Dan-Senor/9780446541473)
goes some way to explaining how a tiny country surrounded by enemies, has
not only survived, but actually thrived.

Israel also leads in inverse relationship between physical and
population size, and the number of:

* [Journalists](https://bbcwatch.org/middle-east-editor-jeremy-bowen/),
  [media outlets](https://ukmediawatch.org/), and other organizations,
  who are [kept in
  business](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3979/unrwa-dilemma) by
  the conflict.
* Famous
  [musicians](http://observer.com/2017/07/roger-waters-antisemitism-documentary/)
  and
  [artists](https://www.israellycool.com/2015/02/15/bunch-of-self-important-nobodies-announce-boycott-of-israel/),
  experts on complex Middle East and global (geo)political issues.
* UN
  [condemnations](https://www.unwatch.org/unga-adopts-20-resolutions-israel-4-rest-world-combined/),
  [as
  confirmed](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/ban-ki-moon-united-nations-disproportionate-israel-focus-resolutions-palestinians-human-rights-danny-a7481961.html)
  by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, shortly before he left the job.

## Food

Like every country, Israel is proud of its culinary culture, which is
decidedly Middle-Eastern with little influence from Ashkenazi
Jewry. You can find chopped liver and gefilte fish, but it's not the norm.
From the most basic street food to the complex and contemporary.

## Misc

* Use sunblock when outside, and respect the dangers of the
  sun. Skin cancer is a big killer in Israel.
* From dusk, mosquito repellent is highly recommended, the amazing
  little gits can really annoy. Or you could just take me with you
  in which case they'll leave you alone and devour me.
