## Intro

Public transport in Israel is somewhat varied in quality, depending on
location. The further you are from big cities, the more threadbare it
becomes, and in most of the country, there is no service on the
Sabbath ("Shabbat"), which runs from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday.

## Bus

Egged אגד is the second-largest bus company in the
world. [Useful bus

## Private taxi ("monit") מונית

Relatively expensive, but door-to-door, 24/7. If the driver offers a
price for the journey, *do not accept it*, but ask them to turn on the
meter ("mon-ay") מונה. The exception is inter-city journeys, which are
priced according to a table which the driver should show you -
these prices *are negotiable*. Available on Shabbat.

## Train

Currently doesn't reach all parts of the country, and
stations are often in inconvenient locations. But if your origin and
destination are connected, then it's often a good option. Tel Aviv is
by far the best-connected city, with four stations, having good
connections to:

* Haifa and north to Nahariya
* Jerusalem - This follows the old line built during the days of Ottoman
  rule. Due to the hills and lack of tunnels, the route is slow, and the
  bus is faster, *but* it is stunningly beautiful and highly-recommended
  at least once when travelling between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. A
  [high-speed rail

  is being built and should be ready in 2018.
* South to Be'er Sheva
* Ben Gurion Airport

## Car

By far the best option for those who can afford it, offering ultimate
independence, especially during Shabbat. Israeli drivers are extremely
aggressive, don't keep enough distance, and use the horn a
lot. Accidents are common, due to the gap between perceived
and actual driving ability. The best advice I can give for the
uninitiated is to "drive your own drive" and don't get caught up in
the madness.

There are toll
roads, [Road 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_6_(Israel))
which runs north to south through much of the country, and
the [Carmel Tunnels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel_Tunnels)
which ease traffic via Haifa. If hiring a car, I advise avoiding the
toll roads, as car hire companies add a surcharge to the
already-expensive tolls.  NB A stretch of Road 6 to the south is
toll-free.

Personally, my best experince hiring cars has been
with [Eldan אלדן](http://www.eldan.co.il/). Make sure the car you're
given hasn't passed its recommended service interval (in a sticker on
the windscreen), that the tyres are in good shape, and that all
scratches and dents are noted before you drive away.

Parking is forbidden next to red and white curbs. Blue and white curbs
usually require payment or a local resident permit during the day, and
are free at night, however this does vary widely. There are yellow
signs at the start of every blue and white section, so ask a local to
translate to be sure. Payment is usually made by the Pango פנגו mobile
app, which is in
Hebrew. [Some legend](https://www.funinjerusalem.com/pango-israel/)
wrote an English guide, but it might be easier to just use car parks.
