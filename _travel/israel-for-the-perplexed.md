I'm often asked to recommend things to do for tourists visiting
Israel. One one hand, there's no need to reinvent the wheel:

* [Go Israel](https://goisrael.com): official site, recently updated,
  surprisingly varied and interesting.
* [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Israel): useful
  crowdsourced travel site under the Wikimedia umbrella.
* [tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g293977-Israel-Vacations.html):
  widely-used portal with rankings, reviews, and lots of useful data.
* Yelp isn't a thing here, yet.
* Netflix is, but it's [severely limited](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Netflix-Israel-wont-have-House-of-Cards-other-hits-440753).
* [Chill is too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVy8pNscbNk).

This page is an introduction. See the sidebar links for more detail on
specific topics.

## Overview

[Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel) is
a [small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Israel) country
in the Middle East, surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan, and Egypt, home
to [8.6 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel)
people. It is a synergy of a rich historic past, with ambition and
optimism for the future.

[Formed in 1948](http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/declaration%20of%20establishment%20of%20state%20of%20israel.aspx),
and fighting for its survival [ever since day
one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War),
Israel is a global leader in many areas, including science, technology,
defence, and innovation. Dan Senor's book, [Start-Up
Nation](https://www.bookdepository.com/Start-Up-Nation-Dan-Senor/9780446541473)
goes some way to explaining how a tiny country surrounded by enemies, has
not only survived, but actually thrived.

Israel also leads in inverse relationship between physical and
population size, and the number of:

* [Journalists](https://bbcwatch.org/middle-east-editor-jeremy-bowen/),
  [media outlets](https://ukmediawatch.org/), and other organizations,
  who are [kept in
  business](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3979/unrwa-dilemma) by
  the conflict.
* Famous
  [musicians](http://observer.com/2017/07/roger-waters-antisemitism-documentary/)
  and
  [artists](https://www.israellycool.com/2015/02/15/bunch-of-self-important-nobodies-announce-boycott-of-israel/),
  experts on complex Middle East and global (geo)political issues.
* UN
  [condemnations](https://www.unwatch.org/unga-adopts-20-resolutions-israel-4-rest-world-combined/),
  [as
  confirmed](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/ban-ki-moon-united-nations-disproportionate-israel-focus-resolutions-palestinians-human-rights-danny-a7481961.html)
  by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, shortly before he left the job.

## People

Israel is much more diverse than the casual observer might
expect. Around 73% of the population
is [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Jews), mostly
of [Mizrachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews_in_Israel)
and
[Ashkenazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews_in_Israel)
descent. Of these, around:

* 42% identify as secular.
* 38% are traditional.
* 20% Orthodox, made up of:
  * 12% are "religious Zionist"
  * 8% are "ultra-Orthodox".

Keeping up? Another 20%
is [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel),
mostly Muslim, Christian
and [Druze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze_in_Israel).

The rest is divided between other Semitic and non-Semitic groups, such as
the [Samaritans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans),
[Black Hebrews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Hebrew_Israelites_of_Jerusalem),
and foreign workers, many of whom come from China, the Philippines,
and Sudan.

This macro diversity is also reflected locally. Let's take the two
largest cities as an example. It's easy to characterize:

* Jerusalem, a religious time-warp, walls dripping with legendary
  stories of war ~~and peace~~.
* Tel Aviv, thinks it's NYC and Berlin, unaware of its real location,
  200km from Damascus and Beirut.

In fact,
[songs have been written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNwJFLkoX80)
about the contrast between the two, which reflect different sides of
our psyche. Yet, Jerusalem boasts a
[buzzing, intimate nightlife](https://www.timeout.com/israel/nightlife/the-jerusalem-nightlife-best-bars-and-nightclubs),
and if you [know where to look](http://eng.ihi.org.il/) in Tel Aviv,
there are many
[reminders](http://www.palmach.org.il/Web/English/TheMuseum/Default.aspx) that
you're in the Middle East.

So, it's pointless to try and stereotype the "typical" Israeli, but be
prepared for a:

* Dry sense of humour, equally fuelled by hopefulness and helplessness.
* Straightforward, robust, non-politically-correct attitude.
* "Seize the day", live-for-the-moment approach.
* Curiosity and interest in outsiders.

Even the climate varies, from the green, hilly north to
the desert in the south. This is a place of contrast.

## Food

Like every country, Israel is proud of its culinary culture, which is
decidedly Middle-Eastern with little influence from Ashkenazi
Jewry. You can find chopped liver and gefilte fish, but it's not the norm.
From the most basic street food to the complex and contemporary.

## Misc

* Use sunblock when outside, and respect the dangers of the
  sun. Skin cancer is a big killer in Israel.
* From dusk, mosquito repellent is highly recommended, the amazing
  little gits can really annoy. Or you could just take me with you
  in which case they'll leave you alone and devour me.
