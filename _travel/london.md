## Intro

I was born in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) and lived
there for most of my life. I'm often asked to recommend tourist
activites, so I wrote this page to help prospective visitors.

As one of the leading cities in the world, London offers something for
everybody. There are lots of great online references such as:

* [Visit London](https://www.visitlondon.com/) - the official visitor
  guide
* [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g186338-London_England-Vacations.html)
* [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/london)

This page starts with geographical sections, then focuses on other
topics.

Most of ["Central" London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London)
is two areas, the [West End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London)
and the [City of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London).

## West End

The obvious first port of call for most tourists. A lively, buzzing area,
larger than some towns, the West End is full of life, and offers
entertainment, shopping, food and drink, commerce, and
more. It's so big, I split it into sub-sections:

<!-- ### Soho / Chinatown / Leicester Square / "Theatreland" -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Last minute theatre tickets -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Charing Cross Road -->
<!-- Denmark Street -->

### Oxford, Regent, Bond Streets

These three criss-crossing streets are the quintessential West End
shopping experience, boasting unmatched scale and variety.

#### Oxford Street

[Oxford Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Street) is a main
east-to-west road in Central London, a shopping destination with wide
pavements and one lane of traffic in each direction. The eastern part
was once tacky, but is improving due to the
[Crossrail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossrail) redevelopment at
the Tottenham Court Road end. As the street continues west, passing
Oxford Circus at its mid-point, it becomes classier, finishing up in
Marble Arch. All the big chains are here, along with icons such as
Selfridges, once glorious, now naff, far too expensive for most locals,
with far-Eastern tourists queuing up for the privilege of entering the
Prada and Gucci sections.

#### Regent Street

At first glance, [Regent Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent_Street)
appears simlar to Oxford Street. The sweeping [Beaux-Arts
Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaux-Arts_architecture)
gets lost from ground level with all the shops and traffic. Regent
Street is generally more upmarket than Oxford Street. The stores are
still mainly chains, but higher-end. They are
bigger and airier than on Oxford Street, and some feel as if they
exist as much to advertise the brand, than to make money.

#### Bond Street

[Bond Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_Street) is the poshest
of the three. It's smaller and more discreet than the others, running
between Oxford Street and [Piccadilly](#piccadilly). The shops may seem
standard in these less innocent days of generic consumerism and
significant wealth, but Bond Street is still the spiritual home for
the likes of Gucci, Louis Vutton, Prada, and other haute couture.
Even if you don't plan to buy anything, it might be worth swinging by
to see how the other half shop.

### Piccadilly

[Piccadilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccadilly) is another
east-west artery, connecting the smarter parts of the West End to the
smarter parts of West London such as [Knightsbridge](#knightsbridge) and
Kensington. A stroll down Piccadilly evokes the aristocracy and class
of a bygone-Britain. In the prosperous modern country, material wealth
is more widespread than ever, but Piccadilly touches on a rarified
world that has little relevance to the average person's day-to-day life.

Landmarks such as [The
Ritz Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ritz_Hotel,_London), one
of the most exclusive hotels in the world, known for its legendary [Afternoon
Tea](https://www.theritzlondon.com/dine-with-us/afternoon-tea/), the
[Burlington Arcade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington_Arcade),
and [Fortnum & Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnum_%26_Mason)
make Piccadilly an essential part of any trip to the West End.

### Green Park

[Green Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Park), one of the
[Royal Parks of
London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Parks_of_London) runs
alongside Piccadilly for a good part of its length, sitting nicely
between [Hyde Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London)
and [St.James's Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James%27s_Park).
Even as the least interesting of the Royal Parks, Green Park
provides a pleasant break from the hustle and bustle of the city, and a
great cut-through from Piccadilly for those visiting [Buckingham
Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace). In fact, all
the Royal Parks in Central London make great cut-throughs, and they
more or less join up to make a contiguous area.

### Covent Garden

Tucked away between the more intense areas of the [West End](#west-end),
[Covent Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covent_Garden) is a
delightful mix of independent shops, arts, crafts, and street
performers. A couple of hours here is a great way to recharge the
batteries. The piazza containing a former vegetable market, now full of
shops, food, and shows, is the most recognizable landmark, and apart
from being a pleasant way to pass the time, provides valuable cover if
the typical London rain kicks in.

The [Royal Opera
House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Opera_House) and [London
Transport Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Transport_Museum)
are also located in the area, and due to its proximity to Theatreland,
it makes a great stop before or after a visit to the theatre.

### Westminster

[Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster) is an area rich
in history and tradition. Being the seat of government and the monarchy,
Westminster is the political heart of London.

#### Palace of Westminster

The [Palace of
Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster),
better known as the Houses of Parliament due to its occupants, the
[House of
Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom)
and the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords),
is the heartbeat of the UK Government. Its iconic Gothic Revival
architecture is instantly recognizable, most of all [Big
Ben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ben) which is technically the
bell in the clock tower, but colloquially used to refer to the
tower itself. The "new" Palace "only" dates to the mid-19th century,
following an [1834
fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_Parliament) which
destroyed the centuries-old original. [Tours are
available](https://www.parliament.uk/visiting/visiting-and-tours/tours-of-parliament/) to the public.

#### Whitehall

[Whitehall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall), the home
of Government ministries, is interesting but off-limits to the public. An
exception to the rule is the [Churchill War
Rooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_War_Rooms), part of the
[Imperial War
Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_War_Museum). It comprises
two parts, the first being the underground complex from where [Winston
Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and the rest
of the
[Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom)
made the decisions that would lead to the Allied victory in [World
War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). The other part is
the Churchill Museum. The concept is brilliantly executed and preserved,
and you don't have to be a history buff to get into it.

The area backs onto [St James's
Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James%27s_Park), another Royal
Park which boasts a lake and waterfowl.

#### Buckingham Palace

[Buckingham Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace) is
the Queen's main residence and another of the most famous landmarks in the
world. It's also [open to the
public](https://www.rct.uk/visit/the-state-rooms-buckingham-palace) and
is surely worth a visit, whatever you think of the monarchy. 

## City of London

Don't let the name fool you. Unlike most areas known as "City", the City
of London is not an obvious port of call for tourists. It's where
London started and spread out from, and in the modern age it's a focus
of big business, commerce and finance, none of which are of much
interest to tourists.

### Barbican

With its
[Brutalist architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture)
that you either love or hate, but can't miss either way, the
[Barbican Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbican_Centre) is an oasis of
art and culture in the otherwise commercial [City](#city-of-london). It
incorporates a concert hall, theatre(s), art gallery, cinema(s),
library, restaurants, bars, a lake, and more. It also includes the
largest residential housing development in the City, the [Barbican
Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbican_Estate) made up of three
high-rise towers, 13 terrace blocks, a mews and more.

### Museum of London

The [Museum of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_London)
sits on the edge of the Barbican complex. Despite its grand name, it's
less well-known than the biggest [museums](#museums) in London. The
[proposed move to
Smithfield](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/museum-of-london-going-ahead-with-70m-move-to-smithfield-10138884.html)
backs up my suspicion that the location is not ideal. In any event, a
worthwhile visit, telling the story of this historic, modern city.

## North London

### Regent's Park

[Regent's Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent%27s_Park) is so
close to [Central London](#central-london) that it could have sneaked
in. Another Royal Park, it's a combination of expensive housing,
wide-open green spaces, lakes

[Primrose Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primrose_Hill) backs onto
Regent's Park, and offers an expansive view of Central London. The area
around the hill, also called Primrose Hill, is famous for rich
arty-types. Its variety of cafes, pubs and small shops make it worth
passing through if you're in the area.

### Camden Town / Market

[Camden Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_Town) is a great
destination for alternative and "street" culture, accessible by bus or
tube from Central London. It's more touristy now than when I went to
school there 30 years ago, but it's still worth a visit for anyone into
rock, punk, goth, metal, and other related themes. I have listed music
venues are in the [venues section below](#venues).

[Camden Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_Market) is actually
five smaller markets next to each other, creating a monster. Budget half
a day for an in-depth exploration. Camden Lock and the Stables Markets
are the most essential. They're situated by the canal, which is worth a
walk in itself, and they offer a wide variety of stalls and street food.

#### Pubs

* [Hawley Arms](https://www.facebook.com/hawley.arms/) is best known for
the Amy Winehouse and friends culture back in the day, today still a
great place to chuckle at hipsters from a comfortable sofa.
* [The World's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_End,_Camden)
is notable mainly for its size and cheap drinks. Not somewhere I'd go on a
date, but worth a pint if passing through.
* Also see The Black Heart in the [venues section below](#venues).

## West London

<!-- ### Hyde Park -->

### Knightsbridge

[Knightsbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightsbridge) is as posh
as it sounds. Without doubt one of the most upmarket
areas in London, Knightsbridge is home to the famous
[Harrods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrods) and [Harvey
Nichols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Nichols) department
stores. With an average property price of around £5 million, and
shopping to match, you may not wish to buy anything, but Knightsbridge is an
experience not found elsewhere. Watch out for visiting Arabs
with expensive imported cars. Ferrari and Lamborghini in
Knightsbridge are like Ford and Mazda in your town.

### South Kensington

I have a soft spot for [South
Kensington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Kensington). An
incredibly wealthy area like [Knightsbridge](#knightsbridge), the
refined, airy area around the station is pleasant to relax, eat and
drink considering its central location. More importantly, it's the home
of the most famous London museums. Each one can take a day to explore
thoroughly, and they are free to enter.

#### Museums

* [Natural History
Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_Museum,_London)
exhibits over 80 million life and earth science specimens, in the areas
of botany, entomology, mineralogy, paleontology and zoology.
* [Science Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Museum,_London)
holds over 300,000 items such as historic locomotives, jet engines,
steam engines, and spacecraft.
* [Victoria and Albert
Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_and_Albert_Museum) is the
world's largest art and design museum, housing over 2.3 million objects.
It contains ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork,
jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and
printmaking, drawings and photographs over 5000 years from ancient times
to the present day.

### Notting Hill / Portobello Road Market

Made internationally famous by the [eponymous
film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notting_Hill_(film)), the area of
[Notting Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notting_Hill) has a lot
going for it. Every big city has areas that went from run-down to arty to
posh, and this is one of those.

The most compelling reason for a tourist to visit Notting Hill is the [Portobello
Road Market](http://www.portobelloroad.co.uk/), the world's largest
antiques market, a great place to browse and explore. Be sure to check the [opening
hours](http://www.portobelloroad.co.uk/the-market/) as not everything is
open every day.

## East London

[East London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London) is traditionally
associated with the working-class due to its proximity to the River
Thames and the docks. It (notably the [East
End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_End_of_London), the closest part
to Central London, has been the first port of call for London
immigrants for centuries, amongst them the Huguenots, Irish, Jews, and
Bangladeshis.

### Shoreditch / Dalston

[Shoreditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreditch) and
[Dalston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalston), like Notting Hill, are
areas that have gone from downtrodden to desirable. Next to the
[City](#city-of-london), Shoreditch has become a typical hipster hub,
strong in art, technology, and nightlife. Moving further from the Square
Mile, neigbouring Dalston is grittier but still a world away
from the deprivation of most of the last century.

### Markets

The East End is home to London's best-known markets, again a homage to
the area's working-class trading history. As always, check opening days
and times to avoid disappointment.

* [Old Spitalfields
Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Spitalfields_Market) is so
close to the [City](#city-of-london) that it might as well be part of
it, but is technically in the East End. A market with a long history,
the tasteful redevelopment of the area hasn't diminished its
considerable appeal. Art and fashion figure heavily amongst the stalls.
* [Brick Lane Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Lane_Market)
Like Camden Market, a hodge-podge of smaller markets making for an
intense experience. Brick Lane itself is also famous for its curry
houses and bagel bakeries.
* [Petticoat Lane Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat_Lane_Market)
Actually a combination of Wentworth Street and Middlesex Street Markets,
this famous clothing market is fully open on Sundays.
* [Columbia Road Flower
Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Road_Flower_Market) may
be less relevant for tourists as flowers aren't something one generally
brings back from a holiday. But the flower market adds colour to a grey
inner-city area, and may be worth visiting if you're visiting the other
markets on a Sunday.

## South London

The [London
Divide](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/8fmivv/could_someone_explain_the_northsouth_london/)
evokes the idea that North London is classy (or pretentious) and South
London is homely (or run-down).  Indeed, most of the well-known areas
are north of the river, but in reality both North and South London are
too large to generalize about.

<!-- * South Bank -->
<!-- * Borough -->

<!-- Bars / Pubs -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Food - don't recommend much apart from Pret -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Docklands -->
<!--  -->

## Live Music

London is home to all types of art. As I have a particular interest in
music, that's where I'll focus here.

### What's on?

My favourite gig tracker
[Songkick](https://www.songkick.com/metro_areas/24426-uk-london)
lists everything from massive arena productions to small dingy
clubs. If you're serious, create an account to track your favourite
locations and artists.

### Buying tickets

The best option is buying tickets from the venue itself. But if
you find yourself stuck without, there is a roaring trade in second-hand
tickets, led by unscrupulous vendors such as
[viagogo](http://viagogo.com/) and [StubHub](https://www.stubhub.com/),
which have high availability at a premium.

### Venues

#### Small clubs / bars

Due to the large number of small clubs, I can't claim to list all
of them. These are some that have touched me over the years:
