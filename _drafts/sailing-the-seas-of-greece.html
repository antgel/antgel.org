<p>I wrote in my first ever blog entry that blogging a lot might be an indicator that things were going less than well. Well, xxx months have passed since my last entry, and not a sniff. So no complaints there. Executive summary: Lots of ups and downs, it was the hardest and best thing I ever did. Funny how often the most difficult things are the best and even though we know that, we mainly sit on our arses watching the world go by.</p>
<p>Now I find myself on a ferry on the Adriatic Sea, and the 23-hour journey offers time for reflection. It's either that, watch Greek TV (so bad), get drunk (it's the afternoon), play on the fruit machines (do I look like a mug?), go shopping (have you *seen* the kind of products the Greeks are producing?), have a nap (it was good).</p>
<p>I can't wait for the disco to start at 11pm - I haven't heard that word since 1987. Lots of Germans on board so I'm hopeful of meeting somebody with an invigorating personality and dancing the night away to Kraftwerk or perhaps some Rammstein, fuelled by Pina Colada and Black Forest gateau.</p>
<p>So I fired up my laptop, wondered what I could do without the Internet, found a long-lost Football Manager 2007 game, and after sacked by lowly Hartlepool, decided that blogging was *relatively* useful.</p>
<p>I'm going to ignore most of the last few months. I had some notes, but who cares? This is the Internet and anything that happened who needs to know that I ate sushi on Rothschild on the 16th June? (NB I didn't, but you get the picture.)</p>
<p>R is getting married in Greece. I have a motorbike that I want to get to Israel. I've always wanted to ride in foreign countries. Greece is nearer Israel than the UK. Cue obvious plan.</p>
<p>I spent so long browsing the Intarweb to sort out some kind of itinerary, it was painful. It should be easy to do this sort of thing these days, but something that I have long-suspected to be true was proven in practice. We have so much information at our fingertips, but that doesn't make it easier to do things, it only gives us more to think about. Like when a road is widened, it just seems to fill up with more cars.</p>
<p>Back in the day, I'd have been happy just to have somewhere to stay in each place. Now, it's ages spent browsing www.tripadvisor.com, in order to find the most appropriate place. Tending towards the *perfect* trip. But take a step back, dude. You know more than anyone that the information age is a massive con, at least with regard to human</p>
<p>Obviously it's down to everyone to do what they feel is right, but with www.everything.com in your www.face.com all the time, it's easy to get sucked in.</p>
<p>Wow, I'm talking to myself on a blog. So, I'm on a ferry. It's going from Venice, Italy to Igoumentisa, Athens. But for some reason, 80% of the people are German. And it's a 22-hour crossing. After a while observing, my main conclusion is:</p>
<p>German women do man-type hairstyles better than anyone else.</p>
<p>No political correctness here, then. Oh, while I'm at it, also, one can forget the idea that Europeans are somehow *inately* sophisticated. For every jet-setting style gimp in London and Paris, there's a country bumpkin whose idea of a good holiday is to take an underpowered people mover, fill it with crap, and drive a really long distance on motorways at a sedate speed. What you see just depends where on the planet you stand, and all possibilities are out there.</p>
<p>Er, obviously I'm cool though, despite being on this ferry.</p>
