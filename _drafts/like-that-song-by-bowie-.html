<p>This is going to be long. Suggest you grab a cup of tea (or preferably coffee).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWm03wYBTbM">Five years</a> ago, in August 2010, I rode my motorbike from the UK to Israel. Surely it was time (or overdue) for another freedom-related adventure. I sold my bike in the meantime (don't ask, it's annoying), so naturally my thoughts turned towards fulfilling a dream of mine, <del>writing an album and touring the world in front of thousands of rabid fans,</del> learning to fly.</p>
<p>Four years ago, also around Yom Kippur, I made my last <a href="https://antgel.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/yom-kippur-ramblings-aka-guilt-day-bike-day-whatever-you-want-it-to-be/">blog post</a> (19 views according to the stats - really pleased I bothered).</p>
<p>In conclusion (yes, I know I just started), it's obviously time to write a blog post about learning to fly.</p>
<p>Or not learning to fly. Hold your horses, all will be revealed. I think I might have spoiled it now, but it's best to set expectations early.</p>
<p>It all started <del>in the <a href="http://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/mothers.html">Salvation Army hospital in Upper Clapton</a> in 1977(*)</del> when a friend (M) pointed out to me that this year, the Jewish High Holidays fall in such a way that they are unusually disruptive to the working week. One conversation with a supportive boss later, and I was in. To a bureaucratic nightmare.</p>
<p>I won't bore you with all of the preparation required to learn to fly as a foreigner in the USA, but for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8Uloqbxy_M">some reason</a>, it's exhausting and expensive. Included:</p>
<ul>
<li>M-1 visa for vocational students - included answering questions about whether I was a terrorist and / or involved in human trafficking.</li>
<li>TSA alien flight program - included getting my fingerprints taken and FedExed to the USA, by the "approved" TSA agency in Israel (a Yeminite home in Rosh HaAyin with four generations having lunch, offering me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh">kuba</a>, kids running around screaming, etc).</li>
<li>Third-class FAA medical certificate - arms and legs present and correct, an attempt by the doctor to set me up with his divorced friend with children ("she already has kids, you don't need to worry about that"), and we're good to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, the decision on where to fly. Not every flying school is qualified for the <a href="http://www.ice.gov/sevis">SEVIS program</a>, and you need the SEVIS form I-901 to even apply for a visa. After much research of the options, and talking to the schools, I decided on <a href="http://www.tailwheelsetc.com/">Tailwheels, Etc.</a> who are actually the pioneers of the "accelerated" learning method, which is intensive and takes you from zero to hero in 2-3 weeks (on average). One requirement for accelerated learning is that you arrive ready to pass your <a href="https://www.faa.gov/pilots/become/knowledge/">FAA Private Pilot Knowledge Test</a>.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>As a "legendary" Florida thunderstorm drew in</p>
<p>(*) Having just searched the web for the hospital in which I was born, for the first time, I see that "The Mothers' Hospital of the Salvation Army" 1) closed in 1986 and 2) specialized in unmarried mothers. Now I have no problem with that, but sometimes you can have too much information.</p>
