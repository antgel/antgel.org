<p>Lame Beatles reference in the title.  The world of mobile phone contracts is pretty dull and this was the best I could do to spice things up.  But this might save a few people a few shekels, so bear with me.  Or if you just want to know what deal I got, scroll to the end.</p>
<p>I've been with Cellcom since I came to Israel.  Actually not quite, I came with an Orange Big Talk SIM (pay-as-you-go), and when I wanted a contract, I ported my number to Cellcom as they offered me the better deal at the time.</p>
<p>I quickly moved to a higher usage tariff (1000 minutes / month) as I didn't have a landline.  Somehow this was incredibly expensive, I'm embarrassed to say what my line rental costed, and I was paying an extra 40ILS / month for a pathetic 450MB data and an extra 120 for an SMS/MMS package.</p>
<p><em>Painful.</em></p>
<p>Around this time, I realised that my landline, which I never use, and which costs 60 shekels / month, includes 500 minutes / month of calls.  This is an interesting point for olim from the UK and maybe other countries.  We're used to calls from landlines to mobiles costing a fortune, so we have big mobile packages and never use our landlines.  Here in Israel, once you go above your monthly included minutes, it's cheaper to call <em>to</em> mobiles <em>from</em> landlines, than to call <em>to</em> mobiles <em>from</em> mobiles.</p>
<p>There is quite a lot of regulation in the mobile phone industry here, and it mostly works in the consumer's favour, as it's an oligopoly.  For example, carriers have to offer you statistics on your call breakdown.  I noticed that I used  around 700 minutes / month - 600 to Orange, 100 to Cellcom, and a few to Pelephone and landlines.  Also, there is no more minimum contract length - one can move from network to network freely.  Finally, if you move carrier and you still have monthly payments due on a handset, the new carrier has to pick up the tab for those.  I'm not sure exactly how that works, it doesn't seem to make sense but whatever...</p>
<p>I decided that I would use my landline more, to get away with a smaller requirement, and went to discuss with Cellcom.</p>
<p>Cellcom offered me 400 minutes and 400 SMS</p>
<p>I explained my requirement to Orange who offered me.  I explained quite simply that I wanted to pay around 150ILS for 400 minutes, 400 SMS, and lots of data.  He said it wasn't possible.  I turned to walk out and he called me back.  Apparently Computer Says Yes.  1000 minutes, 1000 SMS, 1000 extra minutes to Orange, 2GB data.  170ILS</p>
