There are two things that are rarely dull, and sure to raise yet another
circular "debate" as opinion and fact are blurred, and everyone
repeats what they already thought.

1. Donald Trump.
1. Israel.

Not wishing to be a hypocrite, I'm loathe to write on the subject, and
add fuel to the fire. But there is so much fail around, I can't let it
go. It's so wrong, I don't even know where to start untangling it. 

Today, the POTUS declared that the USA recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's
capital. This is apparantly a big deal. I would agree, but possibly for
different reasons that you'd read in the media. There are so many
sources describing the faux-outrage, I don't know where to start. But we
can always rely on the BBC to have a go, this time providing a [handy summary article](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42250340), headlined:

> Jerusalem: Trump move prompts negative world reaction

This on a day when British Muslims were on trial for plotting to kill
the Prime Minister. Of the country that the BBC 

Sub-headline:

> US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as
> Israel's capital has been met with a wave of disapproval.

This has all the relevant keybwords for a media-shitstorm.

But let's take a look at exactly where this disapproval comes from.

Why is this kind of talk acceptable? They're threatening the *whole
world* because of something happening in a specific place, but that's
not something that the mainstream media feels the need to report. They
go all medieval, somewhere been bullying and blackmail, 

Apparently this is destroying the "peace" "process". 

Of course, why would any of them care? They all belong to countries that
choose their own capitals, and nobody bats an eyelid. Israel chose

Totally surreal, that this guy actually does something sensible. I can't
think of anything he's done that's met with any praise so far. But can a
person elected by the free-est country in the
world be so bad? Could it be that he's the anti-Midas, and everything he
touches turns to orange?

Listen to what he said: "Magnificent tribute to peace". Imagine that
anyone else had said that. You'd be fine with it.

Who cares about what Israel says? Why should this be any different.
Who cares about anything he says? Why should this be any different?

Nothing actually changed. As I type, the Czech Republic has recognized
Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel.
