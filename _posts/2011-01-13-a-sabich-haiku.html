<p>I haven't blogged for many months. This is good as it means I have been doing things in real life. I do have some things to get out there, and I'll try to write a bit in coming weeks, but for now...</p>
<p>Whilst sitting in the library, I was contemplating the way that English people don't have a clue about sabich, but they are all over falafel and sharwama. So I wrote my first haiku:</p>
<h1>"The Black Sheep"</h1>
<p><cite>No chickpea involvement<br />
Fear of the unknown tastes good<br />
Turkey blood unspilt</cite></p>
<p>This could also be my last haiku, although I have to say I think I've got a knack for it, and I'm not even Japanese.</p>
