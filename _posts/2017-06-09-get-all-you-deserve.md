Apologies if you thought this was going to be about the Steven Wilson
live album of the same name. I don't usually have much to say about the
UK, a country I left seven years ago, but the June 2017 General Election
in which we've seen the schisms in society widen, is by far the most
interesting political moment for a long time, enough to keep me glued to
the radio all night.

In a modern Western country close to my heart, which has supposedly
become a beacon of "progressive" politics, human rights, and tolerance,
a large section of the general public voted for a Labour Party led by,
Jeremy Corbyn, the most successful Marxist most of us have ever seen in
the UK. Somewhat-related to his extremist views, he's a good and
unabashed[^unabashed] friend and supporter of some of the most murderous,
totalitarian, terrorist regimes on the planet.

[^unabashed]: Either his recent "I never really liked them" or "I was taken out of context" protestations were enough to sway many voters, or the voters are fine with that anyway. Neither option is great.

I could have picked many examples, but one that sticks out in my mind is
his love affair with  Chavez[^chavez]? Seriously? Venezuela
must be one of the saddest stories on the planet in recent times.

[^chavez]: I think about Venezuela because our office cleaner is from there. When he told me what had happened there, being a typical bubble Westerner, not genuinely knowing much about world affairs, I thought he must have been exaggerating. I did my own research and the results were conclusive and shocking.

But at least he came across as believing in *something*. At the end of
the day, people like a strongÂ leader. Simple slogans influence us,
we don't have the time, energy, or desire to process the
genuine complexity of most political and social issues, and we are not
as rational as we like to think we are.

Take Tony Blair as an example. He derived great success from taking the most
extreme parts out of Labour, picking up the so-called "centre" ground,
and building one of the most dominant UK Governments in history. But he
was up against a succession of Conservative nobodies: John Major,
William Hague, and Michael Howard, a group of old-fashioned suits with
little obvious connection to the average punter, and even less charisma.

This time around, the Conservatives[^big] lost their bottle and
attempted to abandon many conservative[^small] values[^values] in order
to sweep up the "centre". However, this insincerity turned off many of
their natural voters, and those who were floating but were looking for
real leadership, not to mention the large percentage of people who'd
"vote for those poncy rich Tories over my dead body" anyway.  They came
up against a person with a personality and a party with a manifesto,
neither of whom had anything to lose[^lose].

[^big]: Big *c*.
[^small]: Small *c*.
[^values]: I'm talking about modern, libertarian values such as individual and market freedom, and an end to political correctness and reverse racism and sexism, not Enoch Powell "kick 'em out" slogans.
[^lose]: Always a dangerous situation, desperate times call for desperate measures.

If Theresa May had a sincere, ambitious manifesto, she'd have
taken it by a mile. If Corbyn hadn't been an extremist, openly hostile
to the values that made and make Britain a player on the world stage,
he'd have taken it by a mile.

Ultimately, the strong survive, prosper, and rise to the top.  Perhaps
there are biological / evolutionary hunter-gatherer reasons for
prioritizing strength over substance, but either way,
history is unarguably full of strong leaders with
questionable-at-best principles.

Even in an electoral district democracy[^unfair], people
get the leader and the government that they deserve. Ironically if
nobody has strong-enough charisma and policy to convince the public to put
ego aside and pull together, the result is likely to leave most people
unsatisfied.

[^unfair]: One of the least democratic ways to approach democracy.
