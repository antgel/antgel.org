# Tough times

It's not rocket science to point out that the UK has been through a
rough month. Not relative to many countries, but relative to its own
past, certainly since the IRA were blowing things up with regularity
from the
[1970s-1990s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2oYrX5E_5I), something
that many grown adults are too young to remember apart from as
a blur on the news.

First,
[Middle East-style](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.625137)
[terrorist
attacks](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/GRAPHIC-IMAGES-East-Jerusalem-Arab-rams-car-into-ultra-Orthodox-Jews-then-stabs-them-423831),
where innocents are blown-up or [run
over](http://www.timesofisrael.com/3-dead-as-truck-plows-into-troops-in-jerusalem/)
when leaving a gig or walking down the street.

Then, the [Grenfell Tower
disaster](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/06/grenfell-tower-blaze-disaster-waiting-happen/),
which, in a world full of destruction and a media that brings a small
amount[^amount] of that destruction into our
awareness every day, has burned something into our minds that will
stay forever. Rarely does a tragedy so-clearly remind us of our
mortality, with healthy doses of futility and helplessness thrown in for
good measure.

[^amount]: The news is already full of information overload, but it's a tiny percentage of everything that goes on.

Strong emotions create bizarre reactions. Large groups tend to, er,
[groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink). Combine the two,
and we see the "progressive" "liberal" giving [Occam's
razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) short shrift, and
suspending logic and rationality.

Rather than blaming the:

1. Terrorists, and
1. Companies and organizations who fitted flammable material to the
   outside of Grenfell Tower, the tragic symbol of human[^human]
   failure,

[^human]: Humans run organizations.

> It's obviously the
> [politicans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FH4lzsRYq8)
> and the
> [system](https://socialistworker.org/2017/06/20/a-system-that-let-working-class-people-burn?quicktabs_sw-recent-articles=6-20)
> which who are to blame[^blame].

[^blame]: Well, mostly. If there's a chance to point fingers, it would be rude to leave the [Jews out](http://www.timesofisrael.com/london-marchers-in-al-quds-day-parade-blame-tower-block-fire-on-zionists/), right?

No matter that disasters have been happening on
Planet Earth [forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian),
sometimes even in [non-capitalist](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ivonaiacob/2016/07/24/venezuelas-failed-socialist-experiment/#7bcce4b041dd)
[regimes](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/01/greek-disaster-is-all-about-socialism.html),
not just abroad, but also [in the UK
itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je65Vw7ndro). A tower block
burnt down killing tens of people in a frightening, unimaginable way,
ergo an entire political system is to blame? Is any political system
able to avert *every* disaster that might occur?

# Art versus real life

Let's digress, I like music. Tonight, if my social media feeds are
anything to go by, UK millenials were mostly talking about Radiohead's
headlining performance at Glastonbury.

*Radiohead.* One of the biggest bands in the world. From their indie-rock
roots, their ambition led to increasing levels of experimentation with
arrangement and sounds, at times sounding more
like electronica than a rock band, alienating and bringing new fans at
each step. Followed by an incredibly loyal core fan
base who idolize and analyze the band and their music, they
are icons for "alternative"[^alt] music in the UK.

[^alt]: They've sold over 30 million albums...

*Glastonbury.* From humble hippy roots in 1970, to one of the biggest
festivals in the world. Looking at [the
buildup](https://www.facebook.com/glastonburyofficial/photos/a.10150183961960964.301221.40513090963/10154390258045964/?type=3)
on social media, it's pretty clear that they're part of the "let's
politicize everything" bandwagon". They even have a ["Glastonbury Free
Press"](https://www.facebook.com/glastonburyofficial/photos/a.10150183961960964.301221.40513090963/10154488416945964/?type=3)
"newspaper", which we can assume is "Free" in the same way as any
[communist country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany) with
["Democratic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea) in the name is
[democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word). "Glasto"
is an icon of live "alternative"[^alte] music in the UK.

[^alte]: Ticket sales revenue is tens of millions of pounds annually, although much of this goes to "charitable donations and running costs"....

As I was writing this, I scanned the setlists for the 3-days of
safe, middle-class rebellion. I can't believe my eyes. Tomorrow, at 4pm,
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn [will appear on the Pyramid
stage](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/16/jeremy-corbyn-pyramid-stage-glastonbury-festival-2017).
Not a band, nor even a singer-songwriter, but the
[Hezbollah-flirting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2ij-683iP8),
[Chavez-hugging](https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/309065744954580992)
leader of the Labour Party.

> As a music fan, you go to a festival and what do you get? A political
> indoctrination topped off by a party leader on stage preaching the good fight.

Good art often has something to say, but here we're not
talking about artists and their lyrics, nuances, stories. We're not talking
about anything to do with art at all. We're talking about a bloke who wants to
be the next [Great Leader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Sp_J-3WW8)
and a captive audience which the other [Great
Leader](http://www.nme.com/news/music/michael-eavis-glastonbury-people-voted-jeremy-corbyn-2091722)
has put on a plate for him. He's going to look like a rock star, and
let's face it, they are far more influential than
politicians. People go for charisma over content.

> Apparently, this isn't a problem.

# Radiohead get Holy

Worlds collide. In a few weeks, Radiohead are going to play in Israel. It will be
a massive gig by Israeli standards, with the usual [high ticket prices](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/.premium-1.772246)
and [crap
sound](http://www.timesofisrael.com/talk-this-way-aerosmith-rocks-out-in-tel-aviv-despite-mic-issues/).
These days for an international artist to play in
the freest country[^free] and only true democracy[^democracy] in the Middle
East, the 19th-ranked country out of 188 in the UN Development Programme
Human Development Index, is seen by the regressive left as
about the [worst
thing](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/03/24/say-what-un-human-rights-council-declares-israel-worlds-no-1-human-rights-violator.html)
they can do. It was refreshing to see that a band who could have used
Israel as an easy way to make a
"statement"[^wife], were more interested in music than politics.

[^free]: The competition isn't exactly fierce.
[^democracy]: Lebanon, whilst confessionalism and Hezbollah are involved, isn't a serious contender.
[^wife]: Hold on, guitarist Jonny Greenwood is [married to an Israeli](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Israeli-Jewish-Arab-rock-group-to-join-Radiohead-for-US-tour-484794)! *#awkward*

Even more surprisingly, usually-introverted singer Thom Yorke felt
the need to come out in public and [defend the band's
decision](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/thom-yorke-breaks-silence-on-israel-controversy-w485142).
This was a remarkable act, given the state of the [bitter art
community](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/24/artists-urge-radiohead-to-cancel-gig-in-israel),
led of course by Roger Waters who famously started an affair with an
[Israel-hating
Israeli-Arab](http://pagesix.com/2016/06/15/roger-waters-moves-on-with-pals-ex-wife/)
whilst she was still married to his friend, until she [dumped
him](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3788626/Pink-Floyd-rocker-Roger-Waters-73-splits-Palestinian-writer-Rula-Jebreal-43-months-long-affair.html),
a symbol of the ugly face of the modern left, ready to castigate their
peers for supporting "oppressive regimes", turning the
[hypocrisy](http://www.dailywire.com/news/283/howard-stern-calls-out-anti-israel-hypocrisy-james-barrett)
[level](http://www.israellycool.com/2017/03/22/reader-post-roger-waters-latest-act-of-hypocrisy/)
up to the max.

Yorke said:

> "It's really upsetting that artists I respect think we are not capable
> of making a moral decision ourselves after all these years,"
>
> "There are people I admire … who I would never dream of telling where
> to work or what to do or think."
>
> "It’s deeply distressing that they choose to, rather than engage with
> us personally, throw shit at us in public."

# Hippy-crisy

This is where it comes together, if it comes together at all. According to
[reports of tonight's gig](http://www.nme.com/news/music/thom-yorke-taunts-theresa-may-shouting-strong-stable-radiohead-glastonbury-set-2092601),
during the set, Yorke made several [derogatory
comments](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/radiohead-glastonbury-review-2017-latest-theresa-may-creep-ok-computer-set-list-a7805901.html)
about under-pressure UK Prime Minister, Theresa May.

I'm sure that this will be heralded by some as genius social
commentary, yet to me it looks like a cheap shot. It's like if she was
to stand in Prime Minister's Question Time saying to the House of
Commons:
> "Wow, Kid A was unlistenable, what the hell were they thinking, I like
experimentation but this is shite."

Just with a larger audience.

Thom, didn't you say:

> "It's really upsetting that artists I respect think we are not capable
> of making a moral decision ourselves after all these years,"
>
> "There are people I admire … who I would never dream of telling where
> to work or what to do or think."
>
> "It’s deeply distressing that they choose to, rather than engage with
> us personally, throw shit at us in public."

What's going on? Is it one rule for the band, who can decide for
themselves without being browbeaten, and another rule for the hundreds
of thousands of fans, at the venue and on the TV and radio? Do "artists"
have a special, superior moral radar compared to us run-of-the-mill plebs?
Couldn't you just have "engaged her personally" rather than "thrown shit in
public"?

> I think we can see where this is going.

As they look down on us, and tell us what is right and what is wrong,
celebrity political geniuses play to our fears about the
powerful people at the top who only look out for themselves. But hold
on.

Isn't using your luck in celebrity to influence thought, quite an
(ab)use of power?  Should I place extra trust in what you have to say
about social justice because you wrote a good song or three? Do you
really need all of your tens of millions of dollars in the bank? Do you
really need to [limit your
liability](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/29/radiohead-corporate-structure-firms)
in case of a loss? Aren't [corporations
evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y888wVY5hzw)? You seem to have a
lot of them, but you won't find me telling you what to do or who to vote
for.

It's a fine line, as freedom of speech is unarguably important. Yet,
(this seems to be a [recurring theme]({% post_url
2017-06-09-get-all-you-deserve %})):

* How many of us get deep enough into the real issues, enough to
  challenge the proclamations of those who have the ability to shout
  louder?
* How good are we at retaining the context and filtering out the noise?
* Do we compensate for our tendency to [seek out things that
  confirm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=659XhcaIcCk) what we already
  think?

I'm happy to hear Radiohead's music. I couldn't
care less what they think about politics, what their favourite food is,
or what football team they support. I get the impression that they'd also rather
not talk about those things, and perhaps the pressure got to Yorke. It's
not easy being the voice of a generation.

It's true that politics has a central influence on our lives. But
*everything* seems to be becoming [unapologeticly
politicized](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/06/why-we-must-politicise-tragedy-grenfell-tower).
Gary Lineker, mainly known for poking in goals from short distance and
[advertising
crisps](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/video/messi-pranks-gary-lineker-new-7291167),
is apparently now an [authority on
refugees](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/gary-lineker-defends-twitter-views-as-the-sun-gives-him-red-card).

The moment a public figure opens their mouth about something which
it's reasonable to assume, they don't understand any better than you and me,
yet the [media gives them a
platform](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/lily-allen-star-sparks-fury-on-brexit-after-saying-the-world-hates-britian-over-slavery-a3443026.html),
[we have a
problem](http://thevarsity.ca/2017/01/22/why-outspoken-celebrities-only-exacerbate-political-tensions/).

The hypocrisy leaves me on the fence about buying tickets for the gig.
Do I want to hear him drone on about peace in the Middle East as if
nobody's ever tried to solve that one before, and all that we need to
change the reality on the ground is a messiah from a rock band and a
nudge in the right direction?

Some will point out that public figures also have a right to an opinion,
but that would be a [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man).
Of course they do, just like the rest of
us, but there's a time and place for everything. Or as Radiohead
themselves might say, [Everything in Its Right
Place](https://vimeo.com/157296965).
