Five years ago, in August 2010, I rode my motorbike from the UK to
Israel.  Surely it was time for another freedom-related adventure.
Having sold my bike in the meantime[^bike], my thoughts turned towards
fulfilment of a dream, ~~writing an album and touring the world~~
learning to fly.

[^bike]: Rule 1: Never sell guitars or motorbikes.

Four years ago, in October 2011, I wrote my previous [blog post]({{
site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2011-10-07-yom-kippur-ramblings-aka-guilt-day-bike-day-whatever-you-want-it-to-be
%}). Therefore it's obviously time to write a blog post about learning
to fly. *Or not.*

It all started ~~in 1977, in the [Salvation Army
hospital](http://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/mothers.html)~~ when M pointed
out to me that this year, the Jewish High Holidays fall in such a way
that they are unusually disruptive to the working week. This meant
taking a few holiday dayss off, and getting a long effective break. One
conversation with a supportive boss later, and I was ready.

I decided to learn in the USA, where it's cheaper and bigger. I won't
bore you with all of the bureaucracy as a non-US citizen, but for [some
reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8Uloqbxy_M), it's exhausting
and expensive. "Highlights" included:

* [M-1 visa for vocational
  students](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/study-exchange/student.html):
  included answering questions about whether I was a terrorist and / or
  involved in human trafficking.
* [TSA Alien Flight Student
  Program](https://www.aopa.org/advocacy/pilots/alien-flight-training-program/aliens-and-non-us-citizens-seeking-flight-training):
  included getting my fingerprints taken and FedExed to the USA, by
  the "approved" TSA agency in Israel (a
    Yeminite family home in Rosh HaAyin with four generations having lunch,
    offering me [kuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh), kids
    running around screaming, etc).
* [Third-class FAA medical
  certificate](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/medical_certification/):
  arms and legs present and correct, an attempt by the doctor to set
  me up with his divorced friend, complete with children[^doctor].

[^doctor]: "She already has kids, you don't need to worry about that"

Then I had to decide which school to learn at, a tough decision given
the serious financial committment and the lack of knowledge what it will
be like before you get there. The decision was severely limited from the
start, as not every USA flying school is qualified for the [SEVIS
program](http://www.ice.gov/sevis), and one needs SEVIS form I-901 to
even apply for a visa...

After much research, talking to the schools,
posting on the forums, I decided on [Tailwheels,
Etc.](http://www.tailwheelsetc.com/) the pioneers of the "accelerated"
learning method, which is intensive and takes you from zero to hero in
2-3 weeks (on average). They are based in [Lakeland,
FL](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/media/06_phak_ch4.pdf).

One requirement for accelerated learning is that
one *arrives* ready to pass the [FAA Private Pilot Knowledge
Test](https://www.faa.gov/pilots/become/knowledge/). In order to do
this, I put my evenings, weekends, and even my MBA[^mba] on hold for a
few weeks. My evenings turned into intensive study sessions, which
was challenging at best. Still, you don't get a
[PPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_pilot_licence) without
putting the effort in. The night before leaving, I was sure I was ready,
I'd gone from a tech and music geek to an expert[^expert] on such
subjects as [Aeronautical
Decision-Making](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/media/04_phak_ch2.pdf)
and [Principles of
Flight](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/media/06_phak_ch4.pdf).

[^mba]: Soon to be cancelled anyway.
[^expert]: For a beginner.

I had everything mentioned above, plus:

* Tickets to fly to Tampa, my chosen base as a more interesting
  alternative to staying in Lakeland. At least it's a proper city with
  nightlife.
* Rental car.
* AirBNB booked in [Ybor City](https://yborcityonline.com/), the part of
  Tampa that falls somewhere between "regenerated", . Except, it was
  actually in [V.M. Ybor](http://www.vmybor.org/), a neighbourhood north
  of Ybor City, but not walkable, partly. I guess that's what happens
  when you're trying to do something that should be expensive on a budget.

I arrived after a long journey, picked up the car, found my way to the
AirBNB. Suddenly shit was getting real.
