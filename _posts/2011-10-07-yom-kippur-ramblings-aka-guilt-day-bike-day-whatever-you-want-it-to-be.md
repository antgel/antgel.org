It's a funny thing, Yom Kippur.  Like no other religious icon it has the
power to move people across the entire spectrum.  Whether you can't wait
to get to the synagogue to beg a deity for forgiveness in an orgy of
self-flagellation, or it's a stark reminder of your heritage which you
resent but can't seem to run away from, emotions are strong, and a
contemplative mood fills the air.

Maybe you were here in 1973, flying over the Sinai.  Maybe you can't
wait to ride a bike down the Ayalon highway the wrong way, to "see
what it's like".  Maybe you are too young for all that history and too
lazy for that exercise and want to sit in the middle of the road
drinking wine and playing cards.  Or maybe you're looking forward
to some peace and quiet.

This is the day that touches us all, this is the last thread that keeps
us connected to our heritage.  The beggar coming
into the hummusiya, wishing chatima tova "a good sealing (of fate)".
Giving him a few shekels didn't seem like such a hassle.  The woman
sitting outside smiling at her photos of her baby scan.  Am yisrael
chai "the people of Israel live".

Some question the way in which Yom Kippur is an imposed day on which
emphasis is placed on not just humility, but putting ourselves down
and vowing to better ourselves as if we go through life day-by-day not
doing our best anyway.  It seems to me that to bottle up a little
bit of the Yom Kippur spirit and bring it into every day, the weight of
this day would be somewhat lighter.  Don't we already have
_enough_ guilt on our shoulders?  Personally I've had enough of
over-humility, I like it that I can hold my head high here, and people
are free to take me or leave me.

Even if we express it in radically different ways, Yom Kippur is that it
marks us as one people. So, just in case, gmar chatima tova.
