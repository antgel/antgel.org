Procrastinating in the library, I contemplated how tourists don't know
what [sabich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabich) is, but show them
shawarma and falafel and they're all over it.

# "The Black Sheep"

> No chickpea involvement<br>
Fear of the unknown tastes good<br>
Turkey blood unspilt

This could also be my last haiku.
