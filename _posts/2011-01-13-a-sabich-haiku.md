I haven't blogged for many months. This is good as it means I have been
doing things in real life. I do have some things to get out there, and
I'll try to write a bit in coming weeks, but for now...

Whilst sitting in the library, I was contemplating the way that English
people don't have a clue about sabich, but they are all over falafel and
sharwama. So I wrote my first haiku:

# "The Black Sheep"

> No chickpea involvement  
> Fear of the unknown tastes good  
> Turkey blood unspilt

This could also be my last haiku, although I have to say I think I've
got a knack for it, and I'm not even Japanese.
