## Intro

I'm often asked to recommend things to do for tourists visiting
Israel. One one hand, there's no need to reinvent the wheel:

* [Go Israel](https://goisrael.com): official site, recently updated,
  surprisingly varied and interesting.
* [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Israel): useful
  crowdsourced travel site under the Wikimedia umbrella.
* [tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g293977-Israel-Vacations.html):
  widely-used portal with rankings, reviews, and lots of useful data.
* Yelp isn't a thing here, yet.
* Netflix is, but it's [severely limited](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Netflix-Israel-wont-have-House-of-Cards-other-hits-440753).
* [Chill is too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVy8pNscbNk).

Now we've gotten the formalities out of the way, let's get started.

## Overview

[Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel) is
a [small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Israel) country
in the Middle East, surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan, and Egypt, home
to [8.6 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel)
people. It is a synergy of a rich historic past, with ambition and
optimism for the future.

[Formed in 1948](http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/declaration%20of%20establishment%20of%20state%20of%20israel.aspx),
and fighting for its survival [ever since day
one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War),
Israel is a global leader in many areas, including science, technology,
defence, and innovation. Dan Senor's book, [Start-Up
Nation](https://www.bookdepository.com/Start-Up-Nation-Dan-Senor/9780446541473)
goessome way to explaining how a tiny country surrounded by enemies, has
not only survived, but actually thrived.

Israel also leads in inverse relationship between physical and
population size, and the number of:

* [Journalists](https://bbcwatch.org/middle-east-editor-jeremy-bowen/),
  [media outlets](https://ukmediawatch.org/), and other organizations,
  who are [kept in
  business](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3979/unrwa-dilemma) by
  the conflict.
* Famous
  [musicians](http://observer.com/2017/07/roger-waters-antisemitism-documentary/)
  and
  [artists](https://www.israellycool.com/2015/02/15/bunch-of-self-important-nobodies-announce-boycott-of-israel/),
  experts on complex Middle East and global (geo)political issues.
* UN
  [condemnations](https://www.unwatch.org/unga-adopts-20-resolutions-israel-4-rest-world-combined/),
  [as
  confirmed](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/ban-ki-moon-united-nations-disproportionate-israel-focus-resolutions-palestinians-human-rights-danny-a7481961.html)
  by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, shortly before he left the job.

## People

Israel is much more diverse than the casual observer might
expect. Around 73% of the population
is [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Jews), mostly
of [Mizrachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews_in_Israel)
and
[Ashkenazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews_in_Israel)
descent. Of these, around:

* 42% identify as secular.
* 38% are traditional.
* 20% Orthodox, made up of:
  * 12% are "religious Zionist"
  * 8% are "ultra-Orthodox".

Keeping up? Another 20%
is [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel),
mostly Muslim, Christian
and [Druze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze_in_Israel).

The rest is divided between other Semitic and non-Semitic groups, such as
the [Samaritans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans),
[Black Hebrews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Hebrew_Israelites_of_Jerusalem),
and foreign workers, many of whom come from China, the Philippines,
and Sudan.

This macro diversity is also reflected locally. Let's take the two
largest cities as an example. It's easy to characterize:

* Jerusalem, a religious time-warp, walls dripping with legendary
  stories of war ~~and peace~~.
* Tel Aviv, thinks it's NYC and Berlin, unaware of its real location,
  200km from Damascus and Beirut.

In
fact,
[songs have been written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNwJFLkoX80)
about the contrast between the two, which reflect different sides of
our psyche. Yet, Jerusalem boasts
a
[buzzing, intimate nightlife](https://www.timeout.com/israel/nightlife/the-jerusalem-nightlife-best-bars-and-nightclubs),
and if you [know where to look](http://eng.ihi.org.il/) in Tel Aviv,
there are
many
[reminders](http://www.palmach.org.il/Web/English/TheMuseum/Default.aspx) that
you're in the Middle East.

So, it's pointless to try and stereotype the "typical" Israeli, but be
prepared for a:

* Dry sense of humour, equally fuelled by hopefulness and helplessness.
* Straightforward, robust, non-politically-correct attitude.
* "Seize the day", live-for-the-moment approach.
* Curiosity and interest in outsiders.

Even the climate is variable, from the green, hilly north, through to
the desert in the south. No doubt, this is a place of contrasts.

## Places

### [Jerusalem](https://www.itraveljerusalem.com/) ירושלים

Israel's capital, a source of human fascination and a magnet for
spirituality, ever since (and before) human beings started recording
history.

It's surprisingly large, and hilly, so great for fitness if you're
into walking. When you get tired, there's always the light rail,
buses, and taxis.

#### Old City העיר העתיקה

The heart of the heart of the heart of the matter. Inaccessible to
Jews and rife with snipers whilst under Jordanian control following the end of
the
[1948 War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War),
until Israel's victory in
the [1967 Six-Day War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War). The
history of this tiny area alone can fill endless books. The abundance
of tourists doesn't affect the unique mystical atmosphere (or is that
simply the tension in the air)? Market traders do thrive on tourists,
try to avoid eye contact unless you actually want to buy something,
and if you do, haggle like you're in the Middle East.

Roughly divided into four quarters (Jewish / Christian / Muslim /
Armenian), the Old City could easily take several days' to explore. I
wouldn't recommend displaying anything of religious or national
significance, unless you know exactly what you're doing. This is a
complex, emotionally-charged place, where you'll find T-shirts for
sale with slogans like "Free Palestine" (image of entire Israel in
blood-red, no suggestion of two states living in peace, side by side),
or "America Don't Worry, Israel is Behind You".

Some of my highlights:

* [Temple Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount) הר הבית:
  The holiest site in Judaism, and the location of the [Second
  Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple) from 516 BCE to
  70 CE, when the Romans nearly wiped the Jews out. When the Muslims
  conquered Jerusalem in the 7th century, they built the [Dome of the
  Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_of_the_Rock) mosque on the
  site. Since 1967, the site has been administered by the (Jordanian)
  Islamic Waqf. Non-Muslims may only enter through 1 of the 11 gates, at
  very specific hours and days, and even to those non-Muslims who do
  enter, access to mosques is forbidden. *At the time of writing (July
  2017), totally closed to non-Muslims in the wake of controversy
  following a [terrorist
  attack](http://www.timesofisrael.com/three-said-hurt-in-shooting-attack-in-jerusalems-old-city/),
  in which Arabs killed Druze Border Police, and subsequent
  [installation of metal
  detectors](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4991187,00.html).*
* [Western Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Wall) הכותל
  המערבי: An Israeli and Jewish icon. Named due to being one of the
  retaining walls, and all that remains of the Second Temple. A new,
  unmissable development, is tours of the recently-excavated
  [tunnels](https://english.thekotel.org/western_wall_sites/western_wall_tunnels/).
  Annoyingly, these do require booking in advance. Technically a
  synagogue, so modest clothing recommended.
* [Church of the Holy
  Sepulchre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre):
  Without doubt one of the most impressive Christian holy sites on the
  planet. I don't have words to describe its enchanting, peaceful aura.
  Religion is never far from controversy, here affairs are dictated by a
  [status
  quo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre#Status_quo)
  going back to 1853, with the equally thought-provoking and prepostrous
  [Immovable Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immovable_Ladder),
  stuck in its current position since the 18th century, except for being
  removed and replaced in a 1997 prank or conflict, depending on who you
  believe.
* [Ramparts Walk](https://www.itraveljerusalem.com/ent/ramparts-walk/):
  A chance to walk around the Old City from the top of its walls. Not
  easy, especially on a hot day, although a great overview.
* [Jewish
  Quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Quarter_(Jerusalem)):
  The newest parts of the Old City are here, following rebuilding due to
  the widespread destruction under Jordanian rule from 1948-1967, during
  which 34 out of 35 synagogues were destroyed.
* [Mount of Olives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_of_Olives): Not
  in the Old City as such, but "around the back" if coming from the
  usual routes. Boasts an amazing view of all of Jerusalem. Probably the
  most famous Jewish cemetery in the world, heavily vandalized under
  Jordanian rule. According to some tradition, when the [End of
  Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_time) arrives, the
  [Resurrection of the
  Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_eschatology#Resurrection_of_the_dead)
  will start here when the Messiah arrives and makes his / her / its way
  to the Temple Mount. (I didn't make that up, I'm just the messenger.)

#### Other things to do

* [Yad Vashem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad_Vashem): The
  world-famous Holocaust museum, located on Mount Herzl.  Following
  refurbishment in 2005, it's an unparalleled assault on the senses. The
  subject matter is unarguably bleak, yet the presentation is admirable,
  and the ending, which I won't spoil, is... Anyway, budget at least a
  couple of hours, and more if you're keen not to rush. I'd recommend
  getting the sadness out of the way at the start of the day.
* [Mount Herzl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Herzl): The
  location of Yad Vashem, and the most famous cemetery in Israel, where
  legendary political and military leaders, and Zionist visionaries,
  including Theodor Herzl himself, are laid to rest.
* [Jerusalem Light
  Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Light_Rail): Perhaps
  the leading symbol of Jerusalem moving into the modern world, and
  often cited as a symbol of bringing people together, given its
  passing-through Arab neighbourhoods. The best way to get to Yad Vashem
  and Mount Herzl from the town centre.
* [Machane Yehuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahane_Yehuda_Market):
  The most famous market in Israel, recently renovated but losing none
  of its unique charm and atmosphere. In recent years, has become a
  happening nightspot, full of cool bars and restaurants.
* [Yemin Moshe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemin_Moshe) ימין משה: A
  beautiful, tranquil, arty neighbourhood, just across from the Old
  City.
* [Israel Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Museum): A
  seriously impressive collection, including architecture, fine and
  Jewish art, and the incredible artefacts of the [Dead Sea
  Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls).
* [The Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset): The site of the
  Israeli parliament, offers [guided
  tours](https://www.knesset.gov.il/tour/eng/evisit.htm) for those who
  wish to see where the big debates are fought, and decisions are made.
  Israel has *never* had a non-coalition government, so it's debatable
  as to which of the two is more common.
* Arnon HaNatziv promenade: Another phenomenal view. (TODO)
* Biblical Zoo (TODO)

### Tel Aviv תל אביב

Known both affectionately and disparagingly, as the "State of Tel
Aviv", reflecting its unique character as the most progressive city in
the Middle East, and / or a snobbiness that it doesn't associate with
all that dust and aggravation. It's small in proportion to its
reputation - other surrounding cities such
as [Ramat Gan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Gan)
and [Holon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon) are technically part of
the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area
(["Gush Dan"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Dan)).

Due to this, the best ways to get around are generally by walking,
hiring bicycles, and using service taxis and buses. Parking is a big
problem, and many locals don't have cars.

## Transport

Public transport in Israel is somewhat varied in quality, depending on
location. The further you are from big cities, the more threadbare it
becomes, and in most of the country, there is no service on the
Sabbath ("Shabbat"), which runs from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday.

### Bus

Egged אגד is the second-largest bus company in the
world. [Useful bus
overview.](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Bus_travel_in_Israel) (TODO)

### Service taxi ("monit sherut") מונית שרות

(TODO)

### Private taxi ("monit") מונית

Relatively expensive, but door-to-door, 24/7. If the driver offers a
price for the journey, *do not accept it*, but ask them to turn on the
meter ("mon-ay") מונה. The exception is inter-city journeys, which are
priced according to a table which the driver should show you -
these prices *are negotiable*. Available on Shabbat.

### Train

Currently doesn't reach all parts of the country, and
stations are often in inconvenient locations. But if your origin and
destination are connected, then it's often a good option. Tel Aviv is
by far the best-connected city, with four stations, having good
connections to:

* Haifa and north to Nahariya
* Jerusalem - This follows the old line built during the days of Ottoman
  rule. Due to the hills and lack of tunnels, the route is slow, and the
  bus is faster, *but* it is stunningly beautiful and highly-recommended
  at least once when travelling between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. A
  [high-speed rail
  link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv%E2%80%93Jerusalem_railway)
  is being built and should be ready in 2018.
* South to Be'er Sheva
* Ben Gurion Airport

### Car

By far the best option for those who can afford it, offering ultimate
independence, especially during Shabbat. Israeli drivers are extremely
aggressive, don't keep enough distance, and use the horn a
lot. Accidents are extremely common, due to the gap between perceived
and actual driving ability. The best advice I can give for the
uninitiated is to "drive your own drive" and don't get caught up in
the madness.

There are toll
roads, [Road 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_6_(Israel))
which runs north to south through much of the country, and
the [Carmel Tunnels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel_Tunnels)
which ease traffic via Haifa. If hiring a car, I advise avoiding the
toll roads, as car hire companies add a surcharge to the
already-expensive tolls.  NB A stretch of Road 6 to the south is
toll-free.

Personally, my best experince hiring cars has been
with [Eldan אלדן](http://www.eldan.co.il/). Make sure the car you're
given hasn't passed its recommended service interval (in a sticker on
the windscreen), that the tyres are in good shape, and that all
scratches and dents are noted before you drive away.

Parking is forbidden next to red and white curbs. Blue and white curbs
usually require payment or a local resident permit during the day, and
are free at night, however this does vary widely. There are yellow
signs at the start of every blue and white section, so ask a local to
translate to be sure. Payment is usually made by the Pango פנגו mobile
app, which is in
Hebrew. [Some legend](https://www.funinjerusalem.com/pango-israel/)
wrote an English guide, but it might be easier to just use car parks.

## Food

Like every country, Israel is proud of its culinary culture, which is
decidedly Middle-Eastern with little influence from Ashkenazi
Jewry. You can find chopped liver and gefilte fish, but it's not the norm.
From the most basic street food to the complex and contemporary. (TODO
fill in sections below)

### Falafel פלאפל

### Hummus חומוס

### Shakshuka שקשוקה

### Sharwama שווארמה

### Sabich סביח

### Burekas בורקס

### Jachnun ג'חנון

## Misc

* Use sunblock when outside, and respect the dangers of the
  sun. Skin cancer is a big killer in Israel.
* From dusk, mosquito repellent is highly recommended, the amazing
  little gits can really annoy. Or you could just take me with you
  in which case they'll leave you alone and devour me.
* Title inspired by the Rambam's [Guide for the Perplexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheGuideforthePerplexed).
