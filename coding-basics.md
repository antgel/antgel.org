## Editors
A good editor is the core of every coder's toolchain. For most of
history, [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) have been the obvious
choices. As coding has become friendlier, other contenders have entered
the fray. Vim and Emacs are still the big guns, but learning and
customizing them is a long, if rewarding, journey.

### Atom
According to the folks at GitHub who wrote it, Atom is designed to be:
> hackable to the core, but approachable on the first day

This makes it suitable for beginners, but powerful enough to last the
course. Due to that, its open-source nature, and its strong community, I
recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) for most beginners. I personally use Vim with a [custom
configuration](https://github.com/antgel/dotfiles-vcsh/blob/master/.vimrc),
and would recommend that for the brave.

#### Useful packages
Many people have written packages to extend Atom's functionality. I
recommend installing some from the start, to make the landing as soft as
possible. The following list is derived from [this rather long list of awesome packages](https://github.com/mehcode/awesome-atom).
* [advanced-open-file](https://atom.io/packages/advanced-open-file)
* [autocomplete-modules](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-modules)
* [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)
* [code-peek](https://atom.io/packages/code-peek)
* [editorconfig](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig)
* [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons)
* [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)
* [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint)
* [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)
* [terminal-plus](https://atom.io/packages/terminal-plus)

If you try to install a package that requires dependencies, Atom will
ask you if you want to install the dependencies. Say yes.

Once you've installed a package, you can tweak its settings in the `Package` menu.
